            I had high hopes at first that this assignment wouldn't take a long time. I was wrong. I realized im going to have to use different past project to keep this blog in a web form, or I could just recopy and paste the same code over and over again, creating endless title pages. Unsure what the move is. Anyways, I created a Margarita App. the icon is a photo of a margarita, as is the background image and of the only screen in the app. initially i wanted a counter that went up from 0 everytime the 'drink' button was hit, as well as a gif that depleted the liquid in the margarita glass. the Webplayer gave me trouble, and then I didn't care enough to continue trying, so I adapted. now, an audio plays of me say "ill have another margarita" whenever you hit the button. in place of the counter, the eternal count is "not enough". PS I used Voice Memo app on my phone to record my voice. This is Blog Post 2.
