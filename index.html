            I tried to do this on wix and it hated me more than i hated it. didnt work out. ok. lets get into it. I know its late. i know you dont care and dont want to hear my excuses so i wont bother. starting with object 1. my class did the second walktrough, when i did this i used the first one and was done in 12 minutes tops. easy, no issues. onject two on the other hand seemed too easy. i have the photo of the desk, and the photo of the clip. i measured the clip to fit my cord and the desk, and pinch them together. should work. object three. i couldnt get this completed all the way, but wanted to show my thought process. im sure you at least can kind of see what i was going for, the path that the jutted out part would travel would ideally continuatlly squeeze the bit, and if twisted enough, would be very difficult to remove. couldnt get the bit to extrude. im sorry.
