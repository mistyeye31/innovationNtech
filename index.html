            My name is Sam. I’m going to try my best to make this post not boring and cookie cutter.
            I enjoy doing a lot of different things. I love bartending and making money, reading, playing video games, exercising, and playing sports. I’ve played for both the indoor and beach club volleyball teams for FSU. This crappy website I made was a small part of my final project in my WebDev class at Endicott College my freshman year.

            I’ll do my best to clean up this site as we go through the semester. I’d like to add more pages, maybe one for each blog post. To be determined how the multiple posts are going to work. This is a public repository on Github, so it should be accessible to anyone with the link. I am admittedly not a very creative person, though I would like to be. There’s a chance that that's the reason I was not very good at coding. Either way, no more for me, I like my MIS now.
